## 🚀 Project Objective

The primary goal of VisionForge is to address the limitations of existing multimedia tools that are often overly complex or require constant internet access.

**VisionForge aims to provide:**
- **Offline Accessibility:** A robust desktop solution for creative tasks without cloud dependency.
- **Efficiency:** Reusable templates to reduce repetitive design efforts.
- **Workflow Continuity:** Project-based saving and loading to ensure you can pick up exactly where you left off.

This makes VisionForge particularly suitable for students, beginners, and independent creators who need a fast, local tool.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

VisionForge follows a **Controller-based, MVC-inspired architecture** to ensure the codebase remains maintainable and scalable:

1. **View (FXML):** Defines the UI structure and visual components.
2. **Controller:** Handles user interactions, events, and bridges the UI with the business logic.
3. **Model (Persistence):** Manages local file storage and project state without the need for external database services.

## 💻 How to Run

1. **Open the Project:** Open the project in Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or any JavaFX-supported IDE.
2. **Configure JavaFX:**
    * Ensure the JavaFX SDK is added to your project's library path.
    * Add required VM options (if necessary) pointing to the JavaFX `lib` directory.
3. **Launch:** Run `Main.java` to start the application.
